# Small Java Exercises

These exercises range over many important topics in code quality and refactorings.

To get started:
1. Open the file with the methods we want you to refactor: [`SmallExercises`](/java_exercises/src/ex_small/SmallExercises.java)
2. Open the file with the test methods: [`SmallExercisesTest`](/java_exercises/src/ex_small/SmallExercisesTest.java) 
3. Launch all the tests, and make sure that everything looks nice and green
4. Start refactoring!

Note that while these are called "small exercises",
they are actually not that easy.
If you're only able to work through a few of them,
or maybe none at all,
that's 100% okay :-)
